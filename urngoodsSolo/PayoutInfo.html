        At the start of this round, you have 40 POINTS and get an additional 60 POINTS if you guess
        the composition correctly. You can potentially earn a total of 100 POINTS, you 
        lose 1 POINT for each drawing you make after the change has occurred (before you make 
        your guess). If you make your guess before the urn has changed composition, you again 
        lose 1 POINT for each draw by which your guess preceded the time the urn changed 
        composition.<br>
        For example, if the change occurs just before the 8th draw, but you do not
        guess the composition until after the 15th draw, you lose 7 points. If you guessed after 
        the 3rd draw, you lose 5 points. The points you accumulate will later be converted into money 
        at the rate of 125 points to one dollar. At the end of the experiment, you will be paid what 
        you have earned in all rounds, in cash.<br>
        The points earned in each group round will be awarded 
        in its entirety to each member of the group. Since there are 20 rounds in total, and the maximum 
        amount you can earn in each round is 80 cents, the theoretical maximum you could earn is $16.
